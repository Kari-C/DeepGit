Hi Both,

Fine tuning still seems like an open topic and without which we cannot even plan for releasing the app for testing to business. As per Eugen’s email, 6th Jan is planned for kick-off meeting for testing.
Please make sure this week and by next week, below topic is addressed.
1.	Fine-tuned model deployment to test system- how to do it, what all terraform changes required and recreate it in dev before moving this to test project.
2.	Regions where its created.
3.	How to use it in the ai pipeline code and adjust the code and environment variables.
4.	Service account required or not and what are the relevant roles it require.(only least privileges roles allowed).
5.	I already noticed about the time it takes to create the letter, few weeks back I reviewed the code with Harshit and found that instead of using create content api call, start chat api was used to create the document and that was taking more than 30 sec and after changing the api call it got reduced to 13 to 14 sec if I am right. Please make sure you use right api’s .performance matters at the end. I cannot approve these kinds of coding without checking the API guides from google. I want you guys to still reduce the time it takes to create the document.

Please refer google documentation for all topics, that’s the only source of truth here. If not raise ticket to google for help.
